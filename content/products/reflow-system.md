title: Reflow System
overviewDescription: >
  The RTECH Catheter Reflow Vertical Laminator stands out as the most efficient
  way to reflow polymers onto a braided catheter sub-assembly and liner. This
  system is engineered to streamline product loading for operators and features
  a special nozzle that ensures shorter cycle times, uniform quality, and
  consistency.
