title: Tack Pro
overviewDescription: >
  The TackPro is designed to provide a seamless, single-step process for tacking
  polymers onto catheter shafts. It is designed to accurately and efficiently
  tack various polymers directly onto catheter shafts. This fully automated
  system allows users to preload all polymers onto the catheter once, and then
  the machine will fuse all the polymers joints automatically.
