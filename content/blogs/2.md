blogContent: "#### Carry out market research.\n\n[Doing market research](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog\\&hubs_content-cta=Doing%20market%20research)\_sounds like a big task, but in truth, it can be as simple as accessing a social media platform and browsing user and blog profiles that match with your potential audience.\n\nUse\_[market research tools](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-tools-resources?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog\\&hubs_content-cta=market%20research%20tools)\_to begin uncovering more specific information about your audience — or to confirm a hunch or a piece of information you already knew. For instance, if you wanted to create a blog about work-from-home hacks, you can make the reasonable assumption that your audience will be mostly Gen Zers and Millennials. But it’s important to confirm this information through research.\n\n#### Create formal buyer personas.\n\nOnce you’ve brainstormed and carried out market research, it’s time to create formal\_[buyer personas](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog\\&hubs_content-cta=buyer%20personas). It’s important because what you know about your buyer personas and their interests will inform the brainstorming process for blog posts.\n\n\"Buyer personas aren’t just for direct marketing. They can be a handy way to keep a human in mind while you’re writing. If you’ve got other marketing or sales teams handy, coordinate your personas,\" says Curtis del Principe, user acquisition manager at HubSpot. \"Chances are that your existing customers are exactly the kind of people you want to attract with your writing in the first place. Your sales and service teams can also have great insight into these people’s needs and pain points.\"\n\nFor instance, if your readers are Millennials looking to start a business, you probably don't need to provide them with information about getting started on social media — most of them already have that down.\n\nYou might, however, want to give them information about how to adjust their social media approach (for example — from what may be a casual, personal approach to a more business-savvy, networking-focused approach). That kind of tweak is what helps you publish content about the topics your audience really wants and needs.\n\nDon't have buyer personas in place for your business? Here are a few resources to help you get started:\n\n* [Create Buyer Personas for Your Business \\[Free Template\\]](https://offers.hubspot.com/free-template-creating-buyer-personas?hubs_post-cta=body\\&hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog\\&hubs_signup-cta=Create%20Buyer%20Personas%20for%20Your%20Business%20%5BFree%20Template%5D\\&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog)\n* [Guide: How to Create Detailed Buyer Personas for Your Business](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research?hubs_post-cta=body\\&hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog\\&hubs_content-cta=Guide%3A%20How%20to%20Create%20Detailed%20Buyer%20Personas%20for%20Your%20Business)\n* [\\[Free Tool\\] Make My Persona: Buyer Persona Generator](https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog?hubs_post-cta=body\\&hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog\\&hubs_content-cta=%5BFree%20Tool%5D%20Make%20My%20Persona%3A%20Buyer%20Persona%20Generator)\n\n### 2. Check out your competition.\n\nWhat better way to draw inspiration than to look at your well-established competition?\n\nIt’s worth taking a look at popular, highly reviewed blogs because their strategy and execution is what got them to grow in credibility. The purpose of doing this isn’t to copy these elements, but to gain better insight into what readers appreciate in a quality blog.\n\nWhen you find a competitor’s blog, take the following steps:\n\n#### Determine whether they’re actually a direct competitor.\n\nA blog’s audience, niche, and specific slant determine whether they're actually your competitor. But the most important of these is their audience. If they serve a completely different public than you, then they’re likely not a competitor. That is why it’s important to define your buyer personas before taking other steps in the blog creation process.\n\n#### Look at the blog’s branding, color palette, and theme.\n\nOnce you determine that they’re your competitor, it’s time to take note of their techniques so that you can capture a similar readership. Colors and themes play a huge role in whether you seem like part of a niche — for instance, a blog about eco-friendly products should likely use earthy tones instead of bright, unnatural colors such as neon yellow or pink.\n\n#### Analyze the tone and writing style of the competition.\n\nTake note of your competition’s copywriting. Is it something you feel like you can successfully emulate? Does it ring true to the type of blog you’d like to create? What do readers most respond to? For most, creating a tech blog might be an excellent idea, but if journalistic, review-based writing doesn’t work for you, then that might not be a good fit. Be aware of what you can feasibly execute or hire freelance writers.\n"
